Overview
========

uSurvey is an innovative data collection tool designed to provide statistically representative real time estimates of a given indicator. It runs on USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) interactive secured channel and on ODK (Open Data Kit), for off-line mobile application for use in locations with intermittent mobile network connections.

The system has been designed to collect a wide range of data for the structured survey; to generate and produce descriptive statistics and graphical representation of the collected information whenever desired, as well as during the process of data collection.
